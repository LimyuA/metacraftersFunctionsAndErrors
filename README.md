# Functions and Errors

This is my 3rd project for metacrafters.

## Description

The 3rd project for metacrafters consists of these 5 steps:
1. Contract successfully uses require()
2. Contract successfully uses assert()
3. Contract successfully uses revert() statements

A skeleton code is not provided in this project

## Getting Started

### Installing

* You can download the ReqRevAss.sol file by clicking on it, and then clicking the download button found at the top right corner of the text file. The download button is beside the copy raw file button.

### Executing program

* Visit https://remix.ethereum.org
* Upload ReqRevAss.sol using the upload files button above the folder named contracts
* Compile ReqRevAss.sol in the Solidity compiler tab located on the left side of the screen. It is beside the Search in files button
* Click Deploy and run transactions button located below the Solidity compiler button on the left side of the screen.
* Under Deploy and run transactions tab, select ReqRevAss.sol contract and click Deploy
* Under the section Deployed Contracts, expand ReqRevAss.sol
* Expand the req, rev, and ass functions

After executing these steps you will now be able to use the program. You can check your total supply by clicking on the total supply variable and expanding its call in the terminal.
You will be looking at the decoded output variable to see the value of the total supply variable.
You can mint and burn functions by placing an unsigned integer value as _value in the function and clicking the transact button.


## Help

Be sure to select ReqRevAss.sol as the contract before deploying
